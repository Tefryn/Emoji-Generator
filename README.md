# Emoji Autoencoder & Latent Space Generator

## Contributors

## Description
This project is an exploratory look into how autoencoders can be used to generate emojis based on latent embeddings. The project is split into:
 1. Training - training of the model to learn the latent embeddings of emojis using a dataset found on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/valhalla/emoji-dataset).
 2. Classifaction - an extension of the model to classify emojis into one of five categories.
 3. Generation - a novel emoji generator by decoding combinations of different latent vectors.
